                members of the Service.
        </li>
</ol>
<p>
        (<strong>i)</strong> <strong>Nature of Rules</strong>. &nbsp;Your participation in the Service is subject to all of the Terms, including these Rules:
</p>
<ul>
        <li>
                <strong>Your User</strong>-<strong>Generated Content</strong>. &nbsp;All of your User-Generated Content either must be original with you or you must have all necessary rights in it
                from third parties in order to permit you to comply with these Terms. &nbsp;Your User-Generated Content should not contain any visible logos, phrases, or trademarks that belong to
                third parties. &nbsp;Do not use any User-Generated Content that belongs to other people and pass it off as your own; this includes any content that you might have found elsewhere on
                the Internet. &nbsp;If anyone contributes to your User-Generated Content or has any rights to your User-Generated Content, or if anyone appears or is referred to in the User-Generated
                Content, then you must also have their permission to submit such User-Generated Content to BW.
        </li>
        <li>
                <strong>Speaking of Photos: &nbsp;No Pictures, Videos, or Images of Anyone Other Than You and Your Friends and Family</strong>. &nbsp;If you choose to submit photos to the Service,
                link to embedded videos, or include other images of real people, then make sure they are of you or of you and someone you know &ndash; and only if you have their express permission to
                submit it.
        </li>
        <li>
                <strong>Act Appropriately</strong>. &nbsp;All of your Service activities must be venue appropriate, as determined by us. &nbsp;If you think your User-Generated Content might offend
                someone or be embarrassing to someone, then chances are it probably will and it doesn&rsquo;t belong on the Service. &nbsp;Cursing, harassing, stalking, insulting comments, personal
                attacks, gossip, and similar actions are prohibited. &nbsp;Your User-Generated Content must not threaten, abuse, or harm others, and it must not include any negative comments that are
                connected to race, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, or physical handicap. &nbsp;Your User-Generated Content must not be defamatory, slanderous, indecent, obscene,
                pornographic, or sexually explicit. &nbsp;
        </li>

                <strong>Do Not Use for Commercial or Political Purposes</strong>. &nbsp;Your User-Generated Content must not advertise or promote a product or service or other commercial activity
                (other than promotions of BizWorld Products as expressly permitted or requested by BW), or a politician, public servant, or law.
        </li>
        <li>
                <strong>Do Not Use for Inappropriate Purposes</strong>. &nbsp;Your User-Generated Content must not promote any infringing, illegal, or other similarly inappropriate activity.

        <li>
                <strong>Be</strong> <strong>Honest and Do Not Misrepresent Yourself or Your User</strong>-<strong>Generated Content</strong>. &nbsp;Do not impersonate any other person, user, or
                company, and do not submit User-Generated Content that you believe may be false, fraudulent, deceptive, inaccurate, or misleading, or that misrepresents your identity or affiliation
                with a person or company.
        </li>
        <li>
                <strong>Others Can See</strong>. &nbsp;We hope that you will use the Service to exchange information and content and have venue appropriate discussions with other members.
                &nbsp;However, please remember that User-Generated Content that you submit on the Service may be accessible and viewable by other users. &nbsp;Do not submit personally identifying
                information (<em>e.g.</em>, first and last name together, password, phone number, address, credit card number, medical information, e-mail address, or other personally identifiable
                information or contact information) on the Service and take care when disclosing this type of information to others. &nbsp;

                individual, unless, and in the form and by the method, specifically requested by BW.
        </li>
        <li>
                <strong>Don&rsquo;t Damage the Service</strong> <strong>or Anyone&rsquo;s Computers or Other Devices</strong>. &nbsp;Your User-Generated Content must not submit viruses, Trojan
                horses, spyware, or any other technologies or malicious code that could impact the operation of the Service or any computer or other Device.
        </li>
</ul>
<p>
        If you submit User-Generated Content that BW reasonably believes violates these Rules, then we may take any legally available action that we deem appropriate, in our sole discretion.
        &nbsp;However, we are not obligated to take any action not required by law. &nbsp;We may require, at any time, proof of the permissions referred to above in a form acceptable to us.
        &nbsp;Failure to provide such proof may lead to, among other things, the User-Generated Content in question being removed from the Service.
</p>
<p>
        <strong>(ii)</strong> <strong>Your Interactions With Other Users; Disputes</strong>. &nbsp;You are solely responsible for your interaction with other users of the Service, whether online or
        offline. &nbsp;We are not responsible or liable for the conduct or content of any user. &nbsp;We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor or become involved in disputes between

        other online activities.

        It is often difficult to determine if your copyright has been infringed. &nbsp;BW may elect to not respond to DMCA Notices that do not substantially comply with all of the foregoing
        requirements, and BW may elect to remove allegedly infringing material that comes to its attention via notices that do not substantially comply with the DMCA. &nbsp;Please note that the DMCA
        provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity is infringing may be subject to liability. &nbsp;We may send the information that you provide in your
        notice to the person who provided the allegedly infringing work. &nbsp;That person may elect to send us a DMCA Counter-Notification. &nbsp;Without limiting BW&rsquo;s other rights, BW may, in
        appropriate circumstances, terminate a repeat infringer&rsquo;s access to the Service. &nbsp;

                Notice, and if you believe that the disabled access or removal is the result of mistake or misidentification, then you may send us a DMCA Counter-Notification to the addresses above.
                &nbsp;Your DMCA Counter-Notification should contain the following information:
        </li>
</ol>
<p>
        (i) a legend or subject line that says: &nbsp;&ldquo;DMCA Counter-Notification&rdquo;;
</p>
<p>
        (ii) a description of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was
        disabled (please include the URL of the Service from which the material was removed or access to it disabled);
</p>
<p>
        (iii) a statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be
        removed or disabled;
</p>
<p>
        (iv) your full name, address, telephone number, e-mail address, and the username of your account;

<p>
        (vi) your electronic or physical signature.

<p>
        Please note that the DMCA provides that any person who knowingly materially misrepresents that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification may be subject to
        liability.
</p>
<p>
        If we receive a DMCA Counter-Notification, then we may replace the material that we removed (or stop disabling access to it) in not less than ten (10) and not more than fourteen (14) business
        days following receipt of the DMCA Counter-Notification. &nbsp;However, we will not do this if we first receive notice at the addresses above that the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright
        Infringement Notice has filed a lawsuit asking a court for an order restraining the person who provided the material from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on the
        Service. &nbsp;You should also be aware that we may forward the Counter-Notification to the party who sent us the DMCA Copyright Infringement Notice.

</ol>
<p>
        <strong>(i)</strong> <strong>Arbitration</strong>. <strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>If we cannot resolve a Dispute as set forth in Section 10.A within sixty (60) days of receipt of the
        notice, then either you or we may submit the Dispute to formal arbitration in accordance with this Section 10.B. &nbsp;If we cannot resolve an Excluded Dispute as set forth in Section 10.A
        within sixty (60) days of receipt of the notice, then either you or we may submit the Excluded Dispute to formal arbitration only if you and BW consent, in a writing signed by you and an
        Officer or legal representative of BW, to have that Excluded Dispute subject to arbitration. &nbsp;In such a case, (and only in such a case), that Excluded Dispute will be deemed a
        &ldquo;Dispute&rdquo; for the remainder of this Section 10.B. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
        Upon expiration of the applicable sixty-day period and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, a Dispute will be resolved solely by binding arbitration in accordance with the
        then-current Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;<strong>AAA</strong>&rdquo;). &nbsp;The arbitration will be heard and determined by a single neutral
        arbitrator who is a retired judge or a lawyer with not less than fifteen (15) years experience as a practicing member of the bar in the substantive practice area related to the Dispute, who
        will administer the proceedings in accordance with the AAA&rsquo;s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes. &nbsp;If The arbitrator will apply applicable law and the provisions
        of these Terms, will determine any Dispute according to the applicable law and facts based upon the record and no other basis, and will issue a reasoned award. &nbsp;If you and BW do not both
        consent to the arbitration of an Excluded Dispute as set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph of this Section 10.B(i), then this paragraph and the remainder of this Section 10.B will
        not apply to the Excluded Dispute.
</p>
<p>
        If a party properly submits the Dispute to the AAA for formal arbitration and the AAA is unwilling or unable to set a hearing date within sixty (60) days of the filing of a &ldquo;demand for
        arbitration,&rdquo; then either party can elect to have the arbitration administered by the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services Inc. (&ldquo;<strong>JAMS</strong>&rdquo;) using
        JAMS&rsquo; streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, or by any other arbitration administration service that you and an officer or legal representative of BW consent to in writing.
        &nbsp;The substantive practice area requirements for the arbitrator set forth in the paragraph above for the AAA arbitration will also apply to any such arbitration under JAMS or another
        arbitration service.
</p>
<p>
        <strong>(ii)</strong> <strong>Nature, Limitations, and Location of Alternative Dispute Resolution</strong>. &nbsp;In arbitration, as with a court, the arbitrator must honor the terms of these
        Terms and can award the prevailing party damages and other relief (including attorneys&rsquo; fees). &nbsp;However, WITH ARBITRATION (A) THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY, (B) THE ARBITRATION
        PROCEEDINGS AND ARBITRATION OUTCOME ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONFIDENTIALITY RULES, AND (C) JUDICIAL REVIEW OF THE ARBITRATION OUTCOME IS LIMITED. &nbsp;All parties to the arbitration will have
        the right, at their own expense, to be represented by an attorney or other advocate of their choosing. &nbsp;If an in-person arbitration hearing is required, then it will be conducted in the
        &ldquo;metropolitan statistical area&rdquo; (as defined by the U.S. Census Bureau) where you are a resident at the time the Dispute is submitted to arbitration. &nbsp;You and we will pay the
        administrative and arbitrator&rsquo;s fees and other costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules; but if applicable arbitration rules or laws require BW to pay a greater portion
        or all of such fees and costs in order for this Section 10 to be enforceable, then BW will have the right to elect to pay the fees and costs and proceed to arbitration, or to decline to do so
        and have the matter resolved through the courts. &nbsp;Discovery will be permitted pursuant to the applicable arbitration rules. &nbsp;The arbitrator&rsquo;s decision must consist of a
        written statement stating the disposition of each claim of the Dispute, and must provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and any award (if any) is
        based. &nbsp;Judgment on the arbitration decision and award (if any) may be entered in or by any court that has jurisdiction over the parties pursuant to Section 9 of the Federal Arbitration
        Act. &nbsp;

                <strong>Injunctive Relief</strong>. &nbsp;The foregoing provisions of this Section 10 will not apply to any legal action taken by BW to seek an injunction or other equitable relief in
                connection with, any loss, cost, or damage (or any potential loss, cost, or damage) relating to the Service, any Content, your User-Generated Content and/or BW&rsquo;s intellectual

        </li>
        <li>
                <strong>No Class Action Matters</strong>. &nbsp;Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be consolidated with any other arbitration or other proceedings
                that involve any claim or controversy of any other party. &nbsp;But if, for any reason, any court with competent jurisdiction or any arbitrator selected pursuant to Section 10.B(i)
                holds that this restriction is unconscionable or unenforceable, then our agreement in Section 10.B to arbitrate will not apply and the Dispute must be brought exclusively in court
                pursuant to Section 10.G. &nbsp;
        </li>
        <li>
                <strong>Federal and State Courts in Boston</strong>. &nbsp;Except to the extent that arbitration is required in Section 10.B, and except as to the enforcement of any arbitration
                decision or award, any action or proceeding relating to any Dispute or Excluded Dispute may only be instituted in state or federal court in San Francisco, California.
                &nbsp;Accordingly, you and BW consent to the exclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts for such matters.

                CONDITIONS AND YOU AGREE THAT WE MAY NOTIFY YOU OF OTHER TERMS BY POSTING THEM ON THE SERVICE (OR IN ANY OTHER REASONABLE MANNER OF NOTICE WHICH WE ELECT), AND THAT YOUR USE OF THE
                SERVICE AFTER SUCH NOTICE CONSTITUTES YOUR GOING FORWARD AGREEMENT TO THE OTHER TERMS FOR YOUR NEW USE AND TRANSACTIONS. &nbsp;Therefore, you should review the posted Terms of Use
                each time you use the Service (at least prior to each transaction or submission). &nbsp;However, the Terms that applied when you previously used the Service will continue to apply to
                such prior use (i.e., changes and additions are prospective only) unless mutually agreed. &nbsp;In the event any notice to you of new, revised or additional terms is determined by a
                tribunal to be insufficient, the prior agreement shall continue until sufficient notice to establish a new agreement occurs. &nbsp;You can reject any new or revised terms by
                discontinuing use of the Service and related services. &nbsp;

        <li>
                <strong>Applicable Law</strong>. &nbsp;These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with, and any Dispute and Excluded Dispute will be resolved in accordance with, the

                investigations, liabilities, judgments, fines, penalties, settlements, interest, and expenses (including attorneys&rsquo; fees) that directly or indirectly arise from or are related
                to any claim, suit, action, demand, or proceeding made or brought against any BW Party, or on account of the investigation, defense, or settlement thereof, arising out of or in
                connection with, whether occurring heretofore or hereafter: (i) your User-Generated Content; (ii) your use of the Service and your activities in connection with the Service; (iii)
                your breach or alleged breach of these Terms; (iv) your violation or alleged violation of any laws, rules, regulations, codes, statutes, ordinances, or orders of any governmental or
                quasi-governmental authorities in connection with your use of the Service or your activities in connection with the Service; (v) information or material transmitted through your
                Device, even if not submitted by you, that infringes, violates, or misappropriates any copyright, trademark, trade secret, trade dress, patent, publicity, privacy, or other right of
                any person or entity; (vi) any misrepresentation made by you; and (vii) BW Parties&rsquo; use of the information that you submit to us (including your User-Generated Content) (all of

                &nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, BW Parties retain the exclusive right to settle, compromise, and pay any and all Claims and Losses. &nbsp;BW Parties reserve the right to assume
                the exclusive defense and control of any Claims and Losses. &nbsp;You will not settle any Claims and Losses without, in each instance, the prior written consent of an officer of a BW
                Party.

        <li>
                <strong>Operation of Service; Availability of Products and Services; International Issues</strong>. &nbsp;BW controls and operates the Service from its U.S.-based offices in the
                U.S.A., and BW makes no representation that the Service is appropriate or available for use beyond the U.S.A. &nbsp;If you use the Service from other locations, you are doing so on

                geographic area, or jurisdiction, at any time and in our sole discretion. &nbsp;You and we disclaim any application to these Terms of the Convention on Contracts for the International
                Sale of Goods.

        <li>
                <strong>Export Controls</strong>. &nbsp;Software related to or made available by the Service may be subject to export controls of the U.S.A. &nbsp;No software from the Service may be
                downloaded, exported, or re-exported (i) into (or to a national or resident of) any country or other jurisdiction to which the U.S.A. has embargoed goods, software, technology or
                services (which, as of the effective date of these Terms, includes Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Sudan, and Syria), or (ii) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department&rsquo;s list of
